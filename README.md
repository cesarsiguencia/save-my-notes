### Application Link/Installation

This render link is a Free Web Service. As stated on Render's website: 

"*Web Services on the free instance type are automatically spun down after 15 minutes of inactivity. When a new request for a free service comes in, Render spins it up again so it can process the request.*

*This will cause a delay in the response of the first request after a period of inactivity while the instance spins up.*"
